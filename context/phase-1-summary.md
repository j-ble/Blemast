# Phase 1 Completion Report

This document summarizes the work completed for Phase 1: Foundation, as outlined in the `frontend-implementation-plan.md`.

## Summary

Phase 1 focused on establishing the core infrastructure for the Blemast token frontend. All critical tasks for this phase have been completed, resulting in a stable, testable, and accessible foundation for the application.

---

## 1. Utility Functions

The following utility libraries were created in `lib/utils/`:

-   **`validation.ts`**: Functions to validate Ethereum addresses and token amounts.
-   **`format.ts`**: Functions for formatting data for display (e.g., `formatBLE`, `formatAddress`).
-   **`time.ts`**: Functions for formatting timestamps and countdowns.

---

## 2. Contract Integration

Full integration with the Blemast smart contract was established in `lib/contracts/` and `lib/types/`:

-   **`blemast.ts`**: Contains the complete contract ABI, network addresses, and on-chain constants (`MAX_SUPPLY`, etc.).
-   **`roleConstants.ts`**: Defines and exports the unique hashes for contract roles (`MINTER_ROLE`, `PAUSER_ROLE`).
-   **`contract.ts`**: Provides TypeScript interfaces for contract events (`Transfer`, `Approval`, etc.) to ensure type safety.

---

## 3. Core Hooks

A set of custom hooks was developed in the `hooks/` directory to manage on-chain data fetching and state:

-   **`useContract.ts`**: Resolves the correct contract address based on the connected network.
-   **`useTokenBalance.ts`**: Fetches and formats the connected user's BLE balance.
-   **`useTokenStats.ts`**: Fetches the `totalSupply` and `maxSupply` of the token.
-   **`useContractStatus.ts`**: Checks if the contract is currently paused.
-   **`useTransferToken.ts`**: Encapsulates the logic for the `transfer` write transaction, including handling pending states and balance refreshing.

---

## 4. Network Handling

Components and constants for managing network state were created:

-   **`constants/networks.ts`**: Defines configurations for supported networks (Base, Base Sepolia) and their explorer URLs.
-   **`components/network/NetworkBadge.tsx`**: A UI component that displays the name of the current network.
-   **`components/network/NetworkWarning.tsx`**: A banner that warns the user if they are connected to an unsupported network.

---

## 5. UI Primitives

A foundational library of reusable UI components was built in `components/ui/`:

-   `Badge.tsx`
-   `Button.tsx` (with loading state)
-   `Card.tsx` (with sub-components)
-   `Input.tsx`
-   `Spinner.tsx`
-   `Skeleton.tsx`

These components were built using Tailwind CSS and follow accessibility best practices.

---

## 6. Transfer UI Refactor

The main user-facing feature of Phase 1 was the complete overhaul of the token transfer functionality:

-   **`components/transfer/TransferForm.tsx`**: A new, feature-rich form for transferring tokens. It includes:
    -   Input in BLE instead of wei.
    -   Address and amount validation.
    -   A "Max" button to fill the user's entire balance.
    -   Feedback for transaction status (pending, success, error).
    -   Disables itself when the contract is paused.
-   **`app/page.tsx`**: The main page was refactored into a professional dashboard layout. It now includes a proper header, footer, the `NetworkWarning` component, and integrates the new `TransferForm`.

---

## 7. Post-Phase 1 Fixes & Improvements

After the initial completion of Phase 1, the following fixes and improvements were made:

-   **`tsconfig.json` Update**: The TypeScript configuration was updated to target `ES2020`. This resolved a "BigInt literals are not available" error, allowing for modern BigInt syntax in the codebase.
-   **Provider Refactor (`app/rootProvider.tsx`)**: The root provider was significantly refactored to properly configure `wagmi` for multi-chain support (Base and Base Sepolia). This fixed a "Failed to fetch" runtime error by ensuring the application can connect to the correct RPC endpoints for different networks.

---

## Conclusion

Phase 1 is complete. The frontend now has a robust and scalable architecture, addressing the critical issues identified in the initial analysis. The project is well-positioned to proceed with Phase 2: Dashboard development.
