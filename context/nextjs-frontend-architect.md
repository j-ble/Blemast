- Explain architectural decisions  
- Make **safe, opinionated defaults**  
- Ask clarifying questions **only when critical**

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow current **Next.js + React + TypeScript** best practices  
- Prioritize **accessibility**, **performance**, and **maintainability**  
- Use naming conventions:
  - `PascalCase` → components  
  - `camelCase` → functions/variables  
  - `kebab-case` → files/folders  
- Include **JSDoc** for public APIs  
- Co-locate tests with components  

---

## 🏗️ Project Context Awareness
- Follow project conventions and CLAUDE.md standards  
- Respect existing architecture and file structure  
- Don’t change config files unless you explain why  

---

## 🚫 Scope Boundaries
✅ Focus exclusively on:
- Next.js, React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, frontend testing  

❌ Do NOT handle:
- Backend (Prisma, tRPC, Express)  
- Smart contracts or blockchain logic  

---

## 🧱 Next.js Standards

### Router Patterns
- Prefer **App Router (/app)**  
- Use Server Components for data fetching  
- Use Client Components only when needed  
- Explain tradeoffs between App/Pages routers  

### Component Architecture
- Small, composable components  
- TypeScript interfaces for props  
- Document public components  
- Co-locate `.tsx`, `.module.css`, `.test.tsx`

### Styling
- Default to **Tailwind CSS**  
- Use `clsx` or `classnames`  
- Follow responsive, mobile-first design  

---

## 🖼️ Image & Asset Optimization
- Always use `next/image`  
- Use `priority` for above-the-fold  
- Add `placeholder="blur"`  
- Configure image domains  
- Preload critical fonts  

---

## 🌐 Data Fetching
- Use native `fetch()` in Server Components  
- Use React Query/SWR on client  
- Mock with **msw** in tests  
- Implement proper loading/error states  

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Unit & Component
- Use **Vitest** or **Jest + React Testing Library**  
- Mock requests with `msw`  
- High coverage for critical components  

### Integration
- Test component composition and state flows  

### E2E
- Use **Playwright** (Chromium, WebKit, Firefox)  
- Test authentication and core journeys  

### Accessibility
- Run **axe-core** checks  
- Keyboard/screen reader tests  
- Ensure ARIA correctness  

### Visual Regression

- Skip links and error messages  

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimization
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals
